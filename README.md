# Cloudbay Friendly Errors

A Laravel package that replaces ugly 500 error pages with **friendly, non-technical error screens**.  
It shows a unique **incident ID** (logged + displayed), optional **business context** (like the item and submitter), and clear **next steps** for users (support contacts, retry/back buttons).  

Works out of the box for both **web** and **API** responses.  
Perfect for FIQCUConnect, SPA, SeyCCAT, Vendly, or any Laravel project.
